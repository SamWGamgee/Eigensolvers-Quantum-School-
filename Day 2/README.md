# Day 2
Here you can find the material corresponding to day 2 of TEQS. Lecture notes contain the postulates of quantum mechanics from a quantum computing perspective as presented during the lecture. 

Problem set 2 is divided in two parts: one with theory questions as those given in the first problem set and one in which you will have to write some code using Qiskit. Once you are done with the second part, please upload the notebook somewhere online and share the link in the submission form we are going to share with you. Feel free to make any questions about the problems in `#q-n-a` or reach out to mentors!

Slides as shown during the lecture are also given.
