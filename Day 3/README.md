# Day 3
Here you can find the material corresponding to day 3 of TEQS. Lecture notes contain the no-cloning theorem and the three protocols discussed during the lecture. 

Problem set 3 is divided in two parts: one with theory questions as those given in the first and second problem set and one in which you will have to write some code using Qiskit. Once you are done with the second part, please upload the notebook somewhere online (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub) and share the link in the submission form we are going to share with you. Feel free to make any questions about the problems in `#q-n-a` or reach out to mentors!

Slides as annotated during the lecture are given. As well as the slides without any annotations, so you can review the concepts and do the exercises done by the lecturer by yourself.
