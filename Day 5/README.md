# Day 5

RasQberry is a great example of how far the human race has come! You can build a little system that simulates and runs quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware! To learn more, go to: https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry. 

You can find the links to the recordings of the RasQberry lecture and the Question and Answer panel with IBMers [here](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS).

Thanks for joining The Eigensolvers Quantum School and good luck on the Hackathon!
